# 2023-10-25 Week 5

- [Lucy](https://github.com/lucyfarnik) proposes a discrete, rather than a continuous, control signal from the agent. For the pole balancing task this amounts to: hard left, gentle left, neutral, gentle right, hard right (or similar). This makes the maths easier and means we can generalize to a grid-world environment later.
  - All in favour
- [Vishal](https://github.com/vishaljoshi24) has done some [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) tutorials and so far it seems appropriate to use for the user-interface.
  - [ ] He intends to make a dummy app this week as practice before starting the actual app for this project.
- [Omar](https://github.com/oemara1) proposes using a reward function based on learning from user input, rather than using a simple computed reward function (e.g. angle of the pole for a pole balancing).
  - This adds to the interactive element of project
  - The general consensus is that this is a cool idea but not MVP (min viable product). It could take too long for a user to train, and it adds complexity to the development. Perhaps something to look at after the mid-November Demo.
- [Jonny](https://github.com/JonathanRaines) is looking into where to host the project.
  - Streamlit provide a "Community Cloud" that enables one-button deployment of Streamlit apps. However, as we are training a Reinforcement Learning agent in the app, we may hit some compute limit. Streamlit also support deploying to AWS so that is an option.
    - [ ] [Jonny](https://github.com/JonathanRaines) to investigate compute limits of Streamlit.
  - [Jonny](https://github.com/JonathanRaines) is also looking at Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) using GitHub Actions.
    - [ ] By next week will have a simple linter set up as a starting point.
- Rachel reminded the group of the Literature Review section of the report and suggested it was useful to do in advance.
  - [ ] [Lucy](https://github.com/lucyfarnik) to brain-dump some papers she is familiar with in this area.
  - [ ] Jonny to summarize and write-up.
- [ ] [Lucy](https://github.com/lucyfarnik) to look into the theory of testing her Reinforcement Learning sections
  - [ ] [Jonny](https://github.com/JonathanRaines) to implement tests as part of CI
- [Jonny](https://github.com/JonathanRaines) is concerned about interfaces, we have several moderately complex parts that need to come together
  - [ ] Omar and Lucy to work on integrating the environment and the RL model
  - [Vishal](https://github.com/vishaljoshi24)'s front end will eventually need to interface with both the agent and the environment.
- [ ] [Omar](https://github.com/oemara1) to read up on RL references sent by [Lucy](https://github.com/lucyfarnik)
- [ ] [Omar](https://github.com/oemara1) to implement a grid-world environment
